# What does “MFA” mean?

This is where work for my paper and eventual presentation for WAY (Workshop on Authentication) 2018, associated with SOUPS (Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security) lives. Although it is public (so that I can
solicit comments from people who do not have github accounts) it is not really designed for public consumption.

1. I don't have the BibTeX source files here, so you won't be able to build until I do that.

2. Building the SOUPS style version versus the legible version requires requires edits in the preamble of mfa.tex.

3. Requires FontAwesome.otf be available, and relies on XeLaTeX (might work with LuaTeX, but untested)

## Built files

Included here is a [PDF of the paper](mfa.pdf) and a PDF of the [slides used](MFA-presentation.pdf) (Be sure to view that in Single Page mode so that overlays kinda work).
